# Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a data engineering pipeline designed to simulate an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution. The system ingests data from an operational database, sanitize and transforms the data into a star-schema data warehouse, and provides visualizations for business intelligence purposes.

The project is built on AWS cloud services, leverages infrastructure-as-code, incorporates best practices in cloud monitoring, error logging, security, and aims to demonstrate a production-like, resilient data platform.
